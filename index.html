            <p>I am a student studying at Iowa State University in Software Engineering.
                This semester, Fall 2023, I am taking 15 credits of classes and SE/Coms 319
                is one of the classes that I am taking. I am definitely thrilled to be in this class.

            <p>
                The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists on
                creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                Navitation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                related to the project itself.
